# 🐍 Python Fundamentals Learning Notebook

Welcome to my personal Python learning journey! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook where I practiced and implemented core Python concepts to build a solid foundation in programming.

## 📚 Project Overview

This project is designed as a hands-on learning experience to understand the fundamentals of Python programming. It includes explanations, code examples, and practice exercises covering a wide range of topics from basic syntax to function handling.

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

- ✅ Variable assignments and basic operations
- 🧠 Fundamental data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `dict`
- 🔁 Control flow: `if-else`, `for`, `while` loops
- 🧪 Custom functions, `*args`, `**kwargs`, return types
- 💬 Working with strings and user input
- 🔍 Error handling with `try-except`
- 📌 Best practices in commenting and code structure

## 🎯 Objective

To strengthen my Python skills for data analysis, automation, and backend development by practicing through examples and building muscle memory for programming logic.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (IPython)
- Git & GitHub

## 📁 File Structure
